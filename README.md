# ASN Rate Limits

This module addresses the situation when 
* crawlers do not identify themselves as a bot (pretending to be human-traffic) and 
* rapidly crawl your site from hundreds of unique IPs and user agent strings bringing your server to its limits and slowing it down.

Such crawler traffic usually comes in under a single autonomous system number (ASN), identifying the network of the cloud-computing platform the crawler was running from.

In such situation, the module 
* monitors your site on every cron run:
    * checks if your server load is above defined limits
    * checks your recent access log entries and identifies IPs belonging to the same ASN and calculates their accumulated number of hits and execution time 
* blocks all IPs from an ASN which overuses your server based on defined limits.
